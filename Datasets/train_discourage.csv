"1. This question is now also asked of people who did not use a train at all in the previous month; results for these respondents are provided in Table 42a. This table continues the series on the same basis as previous years, excluding respondents who had not taken the train in the previous month.",,,,,,,,,
"2. Question was not asked in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2020. It is now being asked in alternate years from 2019.",,,,,,,,,
3. Some of the initially published figures for 2016 were incorrect. They have been corrected here.,,,,,,,,,
"4. Due to changes in the survey in response to covid-19, 2020 data is not directly comparable with previous years, so there is a break in the time series between 2019 and 2020 (see publication introduction for more information).",,,,,,,,,
